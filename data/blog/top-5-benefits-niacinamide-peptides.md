# Top 5 Benefits of Niacinamide & Peptides in Skincare  

When it comes to modern skincare, few ingredients have the proven science of **Niacinamide** and **Peptides**.  
At **SNAYKAA**, we’ve combined both in our **H₂OSKIN All-In Venom Face Serum** and **Face Cream** to deliver visible results in a simple, 2-step routine.

## 1. Brightens & Evens Skin Tone ✨  
Niacinamide reduces dark spots, hyperpigmentation, and uneven tone, leaving skin looking radiant and fresh.  

## 2. Reduces Wrinkles & Fine Lines 💧  
Peptides encourage collagen production, naturally smoothing fine lines and restoring youthful elasticity.  

## 3. Strengthens the Skin Barrier 🛡️  
Niacinamide improves barrier function, protecting skin from pollution, dryness, and environmental stressors.  

## 4. Hydrates & Plumps 🌊  
Peptides, when combined with Hyaluronic Acid, lock in moisture for long-lasting hydration and plumpness.  

## 5. Calms & Protects 🌿  
Niacinamide reduces redness, inflammation, and sensitivity — making it suitable for *all skin types*.
